So we figure if you just stop breathing, maybe there'll be some air for the rest of us, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersForProtectionMajorMavros">With all these large ships of yours, we can't help but feel like you're compensatin' for somthin'. You're being obnoxious and tickin' us off, get lost.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightMajorMavros">Yeah, look. I know you don't think it's that bad, but it is. War's comming bud, just thought you should know.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralManagedToCloseBordersMajorMavros">We got some stuff goin' on right now and would like things quiet, ok? Stay on your side of the fence for a bit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarForSlightNoClosedBordersMajorMavros">Lotta guns on them ships ya got there. It'd be a shame to see 'em go limp if we pulled ours out, wouldn't it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAttackedUnitsMajorMavros">Oh yeah, pick on the little guy. We'll be sure to remember that if and when the tables turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoBribeParagonMajorMavros">Sorry bud, I gotta report ya to our unions. Bribes aren't taken too kindly 'round these parts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarLongPeaceBetrayedMajorMavros">After all this time you're just gonna do us like that eh? Screw you, bud. Hope you can take the heat we'll be sendin' your way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutScienceAgreementMajorMavros">We could use some help figuring some stuff out and, by the looks of things, so could you. Puttin' our heads together may be a good idea, y'know?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorMavros">You got some nice scrap layin' around, bud. You ever think about setting up a trade agreement between us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralMercantileThinkingAboutTradeAgreementMajorMavros">Hold onto your stuff for a sec, bud. You got somthin' we need and we think we got somthin' you want too. A deal's in the works, just a sec.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementFruitfulScienceAgreementAcknowledgementMajorMavros">We still don't know how this screen's supposed to work, but you've been real helpful with helpin' us figure some other stuff out. Thanks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandMajorMavros">Some friend you are. Mind explainin' what's got you in such a bad mood? 'Cuz it's pretty obvious why we're mad...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyMajorMavros">Just passing through, eh? Might wanna pass faster, bud. Trigger finger's gettin' itchy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedSovereignSpaceMajorMavros">Thank's for keepin' off the grass. The lawn's lookin' pretty nice now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationIsolationistPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorMavros">Why's it so hard for you to hear what we're tellin' ya? Friends don't just ignore eachother like that, bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerRecentlyTrespassedMilitarilyUltimatumMajorMavros">You lost? Get those ships gone, bud. Tick-tock.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeDemandAndNoGestureMajorMavros">Mind explainin' what we get outta that?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerDisregardedTrespassUltimatumMajorMavros">Why's it so hard for you to hear what we're tellin' ya? Friends don't just ignore eachother like that, bud</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerRespectedNoTrespassMajorMavros">Thanks for hurrying those ships along, bud. We were gettin' kinda paranoid there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationPlayerMadeNoGestureMajorMavros">Not gonna lie bud, kinda hurts that you havn't thought of giving us a gift to show you're serious about things workin' out here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPlayerMadeGestureMajorMavros">Hey, thanks. This really helps, y'know?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorMavros">Things have been kinda boring lately. Mind if we all share feeds for a bit?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionCancelVisionSharingSenderSignedMajorMavros">You know that whole sharing vision thing was nice, but now it's over. Sorry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionMapSharingSenderProposedMajorMavros">Ever curious just how much of the galaxy we've seen? Sign here, and we'll show you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedHelpMajorMavros">Ey, our ships keep explodin' faster than they explode other ships. Mind helping us out with that?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementCWNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorMavros">Ey, I know we're not close, but we're gonna have to stick together if we're gonna stand up to some of those other groups. How about we make our own alliance and watch eachother's back?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedHelpMajorMavros">We've had some good times, right? Look, we could use some help. If we can form an alliance, there's a good chance we can all pull through. Whaddya say, bud?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementNeedCounterOtherAllianceMajorMavros">That alliance over there is really living it up, isn't it? How about we form our own alliance, a better one, with black-jack and scrappers!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceAgainstCommonEnemyMajorMavros">Woah, you're not fond of those guys either, are you? What do you say we get together and put em in their place?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForGoodRelationsMajorMavros">Look bud. You're awesome, we're awesome, we've been awesome to eachother, but you know what'd be more awesome? Coming together and makin' an alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAllianceForVictoryMajorMavros">Great minds, eh? There's room for two on this ride, yeah? What we could do is form an alliance. That way we don't gotta blow eachother up and can keep others from blowin us up, yeah?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNeedMilitaryHelpMajorMavros">Erm, we thought we had this war covered, but things have headed south. Fast. Help us out, we're dyin' here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralHelpingAllyMajorMavros">Looks like you could use some help. Just hold em off, we're sending in the big guns!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGiftMajorMavros">Here's a little somthing to show we care. We got this, bud. Let's keep movin'.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralSendGoodGiftMajorMavros">That's right, you're getting something from the top of the scrap heap, but you're worth it, bud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandNoGiftReceivedMajorMavros">Are you joking? 'Cuz it's not funny. Were not laughing. We thought we were in this together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAlliedDemandMajorMavros">A demand? All you need to do is ask, bud! We're allies, after all. Don't you trust us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementVeryPositiveGiftMajorMavros">Appreciate the gift, bud... Can't even remember what we were so mad about before. Here's to our friendship!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralWeakGiftMajorMavros">Look, not that we don't appreciate the offer, but that's just not gonna cut it, bud. You really hurt us and this gift doesn't really show you care.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionNeutralNoHelpThenNoGiftReceivedMajorMavros">This isn't working. You really gotta take a look in the mirror, bud. We wanna make this work but you aren't making that easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementReceivedHelpLateMajorMavros">You coulda gotten here a bit sooner, lotta traffic? Well, still, you came. Thanks for the help, bud.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemNoGiftMajorMavros">Wh- what the heck? What'd you say to that system? Where's all the explosions? What've you done?!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemMultipleMajorMavros">Whoa whoa whoa, are you brainwashing our systems?! That's it, nope, we're out. We want NONE of that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementAwokeGuardianMajorMavros">Whoa, this Guardian you woke-up is so cool! I mean he's totally in the way, but that alright, right?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationConvertedMySystemUltimatumMajorMavros">Please stop brain washin' our citizens. It's existentially horrifying and creepy as hell. You don't gotta make us just like you to get us to like you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDisregardedConversionUltimatumMajorMavros">Is it weird to wanna kill someone because they're too awesome? Yeah, it is. But you know what's not weird? Wantin' to kill someone for makin your friends 'n family think you suck.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRespectedConversionUltimatumMajorMavros">Thanks for toning down the whole "one of us, one of us" act. It's nice knowin' we can think for ourselves.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationBlockadedMySystemMajorMavros">Alright tough guy, we get it, you got a big ol' ship with guns. That's soo cool. Now knock off the blockade before we scrap ya.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationDestroyedMyPlanetMajorMavros">Pretty sure that's a war-crime bud. You're sure makin' it easy to recruit soldures who wanna avenge their families.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementOutpostCompetitionWonMajorMavros">Alright, lets get some friendly competition goin' on here. Lets see who gets this set of rocks first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationOutpostCompetitionLostMajorMavros">DANGIT! How'd you complete that outpost so fast? Gah, frickin- enjoy the system, good game.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredOfBorderUnitsMajorMavros">Heh, um. Hey bud? We ever mention how grateful we are that you'd never use your cool fighter ships on us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationScaredAfterAttacksMajorMavros">WHOA, STOP STOP. Geez, we're not lookin' for a fight! What do ya want? You can probably just have it!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationClosedBordersScaredMajorMavros">Hey bud? Your freaky death armada's really got us on edge. Could you move em just a bit further away? </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionWarPreparingHarassWarMajorMavros">Alright bud, square up. Let's see what you got!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationAbusedDiplomaticDemandsMajorMavros">We had a deal, bud! Lets see if your ships are as worthless as your word.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarCordialIdleMajorMavros">Huh, well, um. Yeah, we could be friends. That's cool I guess. You could've just asked though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementForcedPeaceFromColdWarAfraidMajorMavros">Oh heeey... buddy! Yeahhh, glad to, er, see ya! How ya been?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementPeaceUnwillingToUnsureMajorMavros">Huh, crazy. You're actually pretty cool. Who would've guessed?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceMajorMavros">Dude, if you're gonna bother forcing peace, you gotta do somthin' to make us wanna stay in it once it expires. Peace out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementRequiredShowOfGoodFaithMajorMavros">We're thinkin' you should show how serious you are about bein' at peace with us. Got anythin' comin' to mind?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionAppeasementGoodFaithReceivedMajorMavros">That gift you sent? We appreciate it. We're doing swell things with it, let me tell you. Peace is good, huh?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNoshowOfGoodFaithReceivedMajorMavros">So, no gift, huh? Well, this peace isn't doin' much for us otherwise. You're kinda boring.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationLeavingForcedPeaceWarIntentionMajorMavros">Yeah, so, that forced alliance thing was weird, right? Let's see how war works out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticInteractionEscalationNegotiationRefusedMajorMavros">Oh my gosh, dude. SHUT. UP. Leave us alone!</LocalizationPair>
